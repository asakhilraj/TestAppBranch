Click on the link to the webpage and as the app is not yet installed on the phone, the user will be directed to a link where in the user can download the apk from. Kindly wait for a minute for the Journey Banner to show up.

Click on the Journey banner and the user is redirected to the playstore. But as the app is not hosted on the Playstore, nothing will be displayed.

Click on the Deep View Link using a mobile phone, the user will be shown a deepview page with a click to download the app button. This button also redirects to playstore just as above.
Now install the apk and don't open the app, click on any link (deep view or web page branch link) and as the app is now installed the user will be redirected to app instead of the Deep View page or Website.

The APK can be downloaded using the below Dropbox link
